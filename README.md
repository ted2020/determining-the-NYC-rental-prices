# determining the NYC rental prices

### what factors are statistically significant in determining the rental prices in NYC?

### is living near a park has an impact on rent?
### is living near a subway station increasing your rent?

### i am taking a look at a variety of factors.
### such as:
#### crime, population, square foot, distance to subway, distance to park, distance to hospital
#### race factor, number of public and subsidized housing nearby
#### unemployment and labor force participation rate
#### poverty rate, loan rate (credit score)
#### rental vacancy
#### household with children
#### single person household
#### population 18+ and 65+ nearby
#### crowding rate, density
#### age of building
#### number of rooms and kitchen squarefoot
#### new units authorized nearby 
#### notice of foreclosures nearby


### this project is still ongoing!!!!
